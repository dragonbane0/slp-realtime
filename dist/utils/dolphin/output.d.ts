 * We can tap into the Dolphin state by reading the log printed to stdout.
 *
 * Dolphin will emit the following messages in following order:
 *
 * [FILE_PATH]             - path of the slp file about to be played
 * [LRAS]                  - emitted only if the game was force quit before game end
 * [PLAYBACK_START_FRAME]  - the frame playback will commence (defaults to -123 if omitted)
 * [GAME_END_FRAME]        - the last frame of the game
 * [PLAYBACK_END_FRAME]    - this frame playback will end at (defaults to MAX_INT if omitted)
 * [CURRENT_FRAME]         - the current frame being played back
 * [NO_GAME]               - no more files in the queue
